# Haskell-study

## Purpose 
This is an education-only project for learning Haskell porgramming language. It
contains excersices from the ['Real World Haskell' book](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/).

## Licence 
You may use the code as you wish with no restrictions. Although I have no idea
how THAT code may be used at all in real applications :)
