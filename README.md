# haskell-study

## Purpose 
This is an education-only project for learning Haskell porgramming language. It
contains exersices from the ['Real World Haskell' book](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/).

## Structure
All the files are in the following format (which is self-descriptive I guess :) ):

    ch<chapter_number>/ex<exercise_number>-<short_description>.hs

Every file contains a description of the exercise as the top comment.

## Licence 
You may use the code as you wish with no restrictions. Although I have no idea
how THAT code may be used at all in real applications :)
